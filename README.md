# Building Your Digital Library: A Fun, Non-Techy Guide. âœ¨

ðŸ“š **Description**
=================

For this project, I use Python's Faker library to generate a fictional library and connect it to a MySQL server using the mysql-connector library. With these tools, I construct a database named "libraries" and address queries using SQL in the Python framework.
